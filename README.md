🎤 Voice Commanded Program for Basic Code Execution 🤖


This project, created in 🗓️ 2020, is a Python 🐍-based application that uses speech 🗣️ recognition technology to execute a variety of basic programming tasks. These tasks include checking for prime numbers 🔢, identifying even ➗ and odd numbers, determining Armstrong numbers 💡, and much more, all powered by voice commands 🎙️. It serves as an excellent example of integrating natural language 🧠 processing with computational logic to create an interactive 📱 and user-friendly program.

✨ Features
•	Speech Recognition 🗣️: Captures user input 🎧 via a microphone 🎤 and uses Google's Speech Recognition API 🌐 to convert spoken words 🔊 into text, ensuring seamless interaction.
•	Command Execution 🛠️: Performs a wide range of programming tasks 🧮, categorized as follows:
o	Mathematical Checks 🧑‍🏫:
	Verify if a number is prime 🔢 (isprime).
	Determine if a number is even ➗ (is_even) or odd ➕ (is_odd).
	Check if a number is an Armstrong number 💡 (is_armstrong).
	Assess whether a number is a palindrome 🔁 (is_palin).
o	Factorial and Factors 🔢:
	Compute the factorial of a given number (get_factorial).
	Retrieve all factors of a specified number (get_factors).
o	Sequence Generation 🔄:
	Generate a Fibonacci sequence ♾️ (get_fibonacci).
o	Year Validation 📆:
	Validate whether the input corresponds to a legitimate year (is_year).
o	Alphabet and Number Processing 🔠🔢:
	Extract or manipulate alphabetic characters (get_alphabet).
	Handle numeric data for specific operations (get_num).
o	Geometric Outputs 📐:
	Create visual representations such as a triangle 🔺 (get_triangle), a right-aligned triangle 🔻 (get_right), and a left-aligned triangle 🔺 (get_left).
o	Miscellaneous 🌟:
	Detect Armstrong numbers 💡 within a range (get_armstrong).
	Identify palindrome strings or numbers 🔁 (get_palin).
🛠️ Technologies Used
•	Python 3.x 🐍: The core programming language.
•	SpeechRecognition Library 🌐: Facilitates speech-to-text conversion.
⚙️ Setup and Installation
1.	Clone the Repository 📂: Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine 💻:
2.	git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
3.	Install Required Libraries 📦: Use pip to install dependencies:
pip install SpeechRecognition
4.	Set Up Microphone Access 🎤: Ensure your system’s microphone is functional 🎧 and accessible to the application.
5.	Run the Program ▶️: Execute the script to start interacting:
python Voice_Commands.py
📝 Usage Instructions
1.	Launch the program 🚀 as outlined in the setup instructions.
2.	Clearly speak 🎙️ a command when prompted. Examples:
o	"Check if 7 is prime 🔢."
o	"Is 12 an even number ➗?"
o	"Tell me if 153 is an Armstrong number 💡."
o	"Generate the Fibonacci sequence ♾️ up to 10."
3.	The program processes your spoken input 🎧 and returns results 📊 in the console.
💡 Example Output
Say what you want regarding Basic Programs 🎤
Processing your input...
"Check if 7 is prime."
Result: 7 is a prime number 🔢.
⚠️ Limitations
While functional ✅, the program has a few constraints:
•	Internet Dependency 🌐: A stable connection is required for the Google Speech Recognition API.
•	Pronunciation Accuracy 🎙️: Clear pronunciation is necessary for accurate results.
•	Complex Commands 🌀: Overly complex or ambiguous instructions may not be processed effectively.
🚀 Future Enhancements
To make this project more versatile 🛠️:
•	Advanced Tasks 🤓: Expanding support for sophisticated operations.
•	GUI Development 🖥️: Replacing console-based interaction with a graphical user interface.
•	Enhanced NLP 🧠: Improving natural language understanding for diverse commands.
•	Offline Mode 🔌: Incorporating offline speech recognition capabilities.
